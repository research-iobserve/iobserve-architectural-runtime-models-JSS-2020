# Detecting and Representing user behaviour

The folder **'input'** contains the files for the **pcm** folder of iobserve-analysis. 
To run this experiment, run 'TEntryEventSequenceTest.startTests()' and 'TEntryEventSequenceTest.startTestsRME()'. 
If error occur try substituting the analysis call in the AnalysisMain class with the aforementioned calls.
Paths in TEntryEventSequenceTest should be altered according to the location of the input folder and desired result output folder.

The folder **'results'** contains the raw result files of one run of the experiment, that have been used to create the documentation.
